#Angular 1.x wrapper for clamp.js

## What is it?
A simple to use Angular directive for truncating text. Allows multi-line truncation and displays an ellipsis at the end of the visible text.

## Usage
1. add the "ng-clamp" module as dependency to your angular app
2. decorate any element you want to clamp with a `clamp` attribute, specifying the number of lines it should be clamped to, e.g: `<div clamp="1"> {{ youVeryLongTextHere }}</div>`
3. enjoy your truncated text.
